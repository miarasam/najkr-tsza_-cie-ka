# Matrix Path Minimization

This Julia program generates a matrix of given dimensions (m, n) where each element is filled with a random value within a specified range. It then calculates the path with the smallest sum from the bottom row to the top row, moving only diagonally. The program outputs the original matrix, a matrix showing the minimal sums to each point, the path taken, and the total minimal sum required to traverse from the bottom to the top.

## Getting Started
